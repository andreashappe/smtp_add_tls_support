SMTPAddTLSSupport
=================

This plugin adds STARTTLS support to the Net::SMTP class.

In contrast to http://rubyforge.org/projects/tlsmail/ (which replaces the
Ruby 1.8's net/smtp and net/pop3 with the ruby 1.9 ones this plugin tries
to be as unintrusive as possible. The helper functions were copied from
various places in the internet.

The plugin has been tested with Ruby on Rails 2.0.1.

If you like it and have a workingwithrails.com account recommend me,
my username is 'andreashappe'.

Installation
============

Just install the plugin (get the latest version from
http://happiness-is-slavery.net/wp-content/rails-plugins/) It will
automatically (and locally) alter the Net::SMTP behaviour as soon as it
is loaded as a Ruby on Rails plugin.

Example
=======

Enable STARTTLS support globally:
Net::SMTP.enable_tls()

or enable STARTTLS support for one SMTP instance:

smtp = Net::SMTP.new('mymailserver.com', 25)
smtp.enable_tls

check if tls is enabled:

smtp.use_tls? (or Net::SMTP.use_tls? for the global config)

send the message (STARTTLS will be used) just as before:

smtp = Net::SMTP.new('mymailserver.com', 25)
smtp.enable_tls

smtp.start('myhostname','username','password') { |s|
    s.send_message msgstr,
    'my@mailaddress.com',
    'recipient@othermailaddress.com'
}
smtp.finish

or send it through Net::SMTP:

Net::SMTP.enable_tls
Net::SMTP.start('mymailserver.com', 25, 'myhostname',
                'username', 'password', :plain) {|smtp|
    smtp.send_message msgstr,
    'my@mailaddress.com',
    'recipient@othermailaddress.com'
}
